# Solar System Simulation
<hr />

- A Simple Planet Simulation Developed with python (pygame)  
- Earth, Mars, Mercury, and Venus were the only ones simulated due to scale  
- Simulates accurate forces using Newton's second law of gravitation  
- Accurate mass and distance between planets (all data was collected from NASA in AU)  
- Distance between each planet and the sun is displayed  
- Orbits are elliptical but not visible due to scale
