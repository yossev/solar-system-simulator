# Solar System Simulation
<hr />
-  A Simple Planet Simulation Developed with python ( pygame )
- Earth, mars, mercury and venus were the only ones simulated due to scale
- Simulates accurate forces using Newton's second law of gravitiation
- Accurate mass and distance between planets ( all data was collected from NASA in AU )
- Distance between each planet and the sun is displayed
- Orbits are elliptical but not visible due to scale
